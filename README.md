## Introduction

The Japanese written system comes from the chinese one. So the japanese radicals or _"bushu"_ comes from the chinese Kangxi radical.
With the years it has evolve a bit differently but they remain very similar.

It gets a bit complicated because not all radicals are recognized by the ministry of education in japan (Or at least I have seen multiple interpretations, and extended radicals).

The Japanese ministry of education released the [Jōyō kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji) which is the official kanji dictionary (writing, meaning, pronunciation).
This would be the base for our radicals.

> Japanese kanjis have both a chinese _"Onyomi"_ and japanese _"kunyomi"_ pronunciation. 

## Sources

First radical kanji list comes from [kanjialive](http://kanjialive.com), however radicals were all written in utf-8 chinese instead of japanese, 
so I combined it with [wikipedia kanji list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_kanji_radicals_by_stroke_count) which for some had different meanings.
 
So I cross checked with [jitenon](https://jitenon.com/cat/radical_top.php) an online japanese dictionary and [jlearn](https://jlearn.net/Kanji/SearchByRadical)
for learning japanese and radicals.
